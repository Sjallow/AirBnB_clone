AirBnB clone - Web static
This is a clone of the popular AirBnB website, created using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project is to re-create the look and feel of AirBnB, as close as possible.

The layout of the website is based on the original AirBnB website and includes all the same features. Navigation is done using the top navigation bar, with links to the homepage, search page, and user profile page.

The homepage contains a search form, as well as a list of popular destinations. The search page allows users to search for listings in their desired location. The user profile page allows users to view their past bookings, list their own properties, and manage their account settings.

All pages are styled using CSS, with the same colors, fonts, and layout as the original AirBnB website. The code is organized into separate HTML and CSS files for easier maintenance.
